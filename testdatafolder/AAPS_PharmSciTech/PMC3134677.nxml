A recent paper has outlined the different physical and chemical properties of various recombinant human erythropoietin products sold around the world. This study showed significant differences between such large protein products, with drug products from Korea, India, and China containing more glycoforms and other impurities compared with the innovator product manufactured by Amgen, Inc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). The results of this study prompted an investigation comparing two drug products containing the small molecule proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a product made in India (Bortenat, Natco Pharma) and the innovator product (VELCADE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Janssen-Cilag), which is manufactured in the United States and Europe. VELCADE has had its new drug application (NDA) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and holds the marketing authorization application approved by the European Medicines Agency.</p><p>Bortezomib is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid. The chemical name for bortezomib, the monomeric boronic acid, is [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazinylcarbonyl) amino] propyl]amino]butyl] boronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). VELCADE is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma following at least one prior therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). In the European Union (EU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) and Canada, VELCADE in combination with melphalan and prednisone is an approved treatment for patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are ineligible for high-dose therapy and stem cell transplantation. In these countries and in many other countries worldwide, VELCADE is also approved as a single-agent treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. The chemical structure of bortezomib (the free boronic acid) is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). The drug product is provided as a mannitol boronic ester, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, which, in reconstituted form, consists of the mannitol ester in equilibrium with its hydrolysis product, the monomeric boronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). This equilibrium means that drug products containing bortezomib are unique and chemically complex. VELCADE is supplied as a lyophilized powder in single-dose vials containing 3.5&#x000a0;mg bortezomib and 35&#x000a0;mg mannitol, USP, which is reconstituted in 0.9% saline to a final concentration of 1&#x000a0;mg/1&#x000a0;mL and administered by intravenous injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). The drug substance in the solid state exists in its cyclic anhydride form as a trimeric boroxine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>).

The resulting boronic acid to ester ratios were the same at both time points, indicating that the difference between VELCADE and Bortenat persists long after equilibrium is expected to be achieved. The bortezomib to mannitol ratio was higher for Bortenat than VELCADE (0.55:1 <italic>versus</italic> 0.33:1), which is likely to be one reason that the boronic acid to ester ratios are consistently maintained in aqueous solution.</p><p>The slight peak shifting observed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> is attributed to chemical exchange. The peaks that shift are not from the exchanging protons (OH and/or NH) because the water resonance dominates most of the exchanging protons and prevents them from being observed under these conditions. The peak shifting may be caused by the variable exchange of mannitol protons in the Bortenat and VELCADE samples, which then affects the peak positions of protons several bonds away. The peak shifting may also be due to differences in the acid/ester equilibrium, which is clearly different for Bortenat and VELCADE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The observed chemical shifts are determined by the population-weighted average chemical shift of each environment experienced by the exchanging protons even though they do not produce observable peaks in the spectra. The peak shifting was not due to a systematic referencing error because the aromatic protons of the benzyl group in the spectra of both the Bortenat and VELCADE samples were essentially superimposable under these conditions, which is consistent with the fact that these aromatic protons would be almost entirely unaffected by chemical exchange.</p><p>The Bortenat 2-mg sample was also analyzed by the direct-infusion MS method.

The Bortenat solution was also monitored at 2, 5, 8, and 24&#x000a0;h by MS, and the relative ratio of ester to free acid was constant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>HPLC Analysis</title><p>The amount of bortezomib present (assay) in the Bortenat 2- and 3.5-mg vials and VELCADE 3.5-mg vials was analyzed using a validated HPLC method. Ten vials of each product were analyzed individually. The mean value of ten vials was reported as the overall assay for each bortezomib product, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">III</xref>, along with the content uniformity of each product. The assays of Bortenat 2&#x000a0;mg (116.5%) and 3.5&#x000a0;mg (117.9%) were above the approved specification limit for assay of bortezomib in VELCADE; 90.0&#x02013;110.0% in the US and 95&#x02013;105% in the EU. In addition, Bortenat 2-mg vials showed a higher level of total impurities (0.96%) than Bortenat 3.5&#x000a0;mg (0.23%) and VELCADE 3.5&#x000a0;mg (0.28%) vials.

Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref> lists the volatile compounds identified by GC/MS and quantitated by GC/FID.

Isovaleraldehyde, a compound typically found in fragrance and flavoring agents, was also detected in the Bortenat 2-mg vials (3.83&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/vial) but not in the Bortenat 3.5-mg vials or in the VELCADE samples. The source of this material is not known.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The finding that the Bortenat samples analyzed did not comply with the US- and European-approved regulatory assay limits and contained higher than labeled amounts of active drug has potential clinical consequences. If this bortezomib-containing product were administered in accordance with the approved single-agent dose and schedule for VELCADE in patients with multiple myeloma (1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days&#x000a0;1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3&#x000a0;weeks), the potencies of 116.5% and 117.9% determined for the Bortenat 2-mg and 3.5-mg vials would result in the equivalent administration of 1.51 and 1.53&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> bortezomib, respectively, at each dosing. There are several indications in the medical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>) as well as in publicly available regulatory review documents from the US FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>) and European Medicines Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>) that administering bortezomib at doses greater than 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on the standard biweekly schedule increases the incidence of toxicities known to be associated with bortezomib use.</p><p>This increase in toxicity with higher bortezomib dose has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. An early dose-finding phase I study of bortezomib using the standard biweekly schedule initially recommended administering bortezomib at 1.56&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). This was later revised to 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>) due to dose-limiting toxicities that included diarrhea and painful sensory neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Across a variety of phase I studies, the dose&#x02013;toxicity relationship was confirmed, with the proportion of patients that stopped receiving treatment due to toxicity being higher with increased dose (10% at doses of 0.7&#x02013;1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 30% at doses greater than 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). After these findings were reported, the development of bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma continued using the standard twice-weekly schedule with the 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Similarly, in two separate phase II studies investigating bortezomib using the twice-weekly schedule in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and in recurrent ovarian cancer, the initial dose of 1.5&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> had to be decreased to 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> during the course of the study as the majority of patients treated at the 1.5&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose required dose reductions or premature treatment discontinuations due to toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Recently, a case series of three patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and renal impairment reported the development of severe neuropathy in two of these three patients after treatment with Bortenat, at a reduced dose in the first cycle and at a dose of 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> in subsequent cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>).</p><p>Additional differences between the two products were identified. Bortenat 2-mg vials contained isovaleraldehyde, a compound used in fragrances or as a flavoring agent; the origin of this compound is unknown. Bortenat also contained higher levels of polysiloxane compounds. The toxicologic and clinical impact of these differences is unknown. It is also interesting to note that the NMR and MS analyses indicated the presence of a higher proportion of free boronic acid in the aqueous Bortenat solution. The ratio of free acid to boronic ester was higher in the Bortenat 2-mg (0.27:1) and 3.5-mg (0.13:1) vials than in the VELCADE 3.5-mg vials (0.10:1). Ratio data were included in regulatory applications for VELCADE and the ratio of boronic acid to boronic ester is used to characterize the innovator product. These ratio data also indicate that the Bortenat bortezomib product is not equivalent to the innovator product. The clinical impact of these differences is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Overall, these analyses of Bortenat and VELCADE indicate differences between these two products. The difference in assay results may have a clinical impact, potentially resulting in increased toxicities if patients are administered the Bortenat product at a dose of 1.3&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> according to the prescribing information on single-agent use of VELCADE.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Funding for this study was provided by Janssen-Cilag International NV, Beerse, Belgium.
