The authors of this review (RL and MFA) have been having adventures together since 1991 in their own Lilliputian world of applying nanotechnology to the biomedical science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>) using atomic force microscopy (AFM). This review will focus on the application of multidimensional atomic force microscope (m-AFM) to nanopharmacology in defining the structural targets for drug action, in drug design and delivery systems, in monitoring target&#x02013;drug interaction and in tracking their outcomes at the molecular level. We will begin this review with a brief introduction to AFM principles, imaging modes, and their unique advantages.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Operating Principle of AFM</title><p>Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1986 for inventing the scanning tunneling microscope 5&#x000a0;years after describing the method. In 1986, Binnig <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>) developed the atomic force microscope, a technique that evolved into a series of scanning probe microscopes. The genius of the approach for AFM, like other related scanning probe microscopes, is that it uses the physical interactions between a cantilevered probe (tip) and the specimen for imaging as it scans over the specimen&#x02019;s features. A very sharp cantilevered tip passively senses the localized interaction forces between the atoms of the scanning tip and the specimen surface as either the tip or the specimen is raster scanned in the <italic>x</italic>-<italic>y</italic> plane over its complement (tip or sample). The raster scanning is accomplished either by attaching the sample or the cantilevered tip itself to a scanner. The cantilever is commonly made of silicon or silicon nitride, although other materials can be used, and the radius of curvature of the tip is in the order of nanometers. The scanner consists of piezoelectric ceramic elements with a sub-nanometer hardware resolution. The <italic>z</italic> (vertical) position of the sample (or tip) is monitored by an electronic feedback circuit that maintains a constant deflection, ensuring a constant force of interaction between the cantilever tip and sample. The deflection of the cantilever is proportional to the interaction force between the sample and the AFM probe. The amount of <italic>z</italic> variation needed to maintain the interaction force constant is plotted <italic>versus</italic> the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinate, thereby producing a topographic image. Most commonly, the cantilever deflection is monitored by bouncing a laser beam on the back of the cantilever to a quadrant photodetector which converts light signal into electrical signal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, top left panel) that is fed to an electronic feedback circuit that generate necessary voltage to the piezocrystal to maintain the tip&#x02013;specimen distance constant and hence follow the sample surface contour to provide a 3D topographical image.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Multimodal AFM. <italic>Top left</italic> Operating principle of AFM. A cantilevered tip is scanned over the sample, maintaining constant force using feedback control to keep cantilever deflection at constant amplitude. Cantilever deflection, in this example, is measured using an optical beam deflection system. <italic>Top right</italic> Scanning electron microscope image of a microfabricated integrated nanotube cantilevered tip; <italic>inset</italic> shows the nanometer-sized tip (adapted from Chen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>)). <italic>Bottom Left</italic> A schematic diagram of the optical components of an AFM combined with a light fluorescence microscope. The optical focusing of the laser light is integrated within the piezotube which provides the lateral movement of the cantilever. The scanning lens is located inside the lower segment, which provides the vertical movement of the cantilever. After the positions of the lenses are adjusted, the scanning focused spot accurately tracks the cantilever, and the zero deflection signal from the four-segment photodiode is independent of position within the scan area. The AFM is placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (adapted from Hansma <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>)). <italic>Bottom right</italic> Internalization of small liposomes: light microscopy (<bold>a</bold>), fluorescence (<bold>b</bold>), and tapping mode AFM (<bold>c</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold>) imaging of fixed cells at different time intervals after incubating with cisplatin-encapsulated liposomes. Height mode images (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>e</bold>) and error mode images (<bold>d</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) of the same cells. Error mode images show better contrast and ultrastructural details. The liposomal position with respect to the cell membrane was determined from the height mode images. For cells incubated with cisplatin-encapsulated liposomes for only 1-h incubation sample, many large liposomes are seen on the cell surface (<italic>red arrows</italic> in <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>d</bold>). On the other hand, small cisplatin-encapsulated liposomes appear to be internalized in the cell cytoplasm (<italic>black arrows</italic> in <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>). The <italic>inset</italic> in <bold>d</bold> shows a zoomed-in portion of the encircled area: the internalized liposomes are clusters of small liposomes (<italic>white arrows</italic>) of ~250-nm diameter. After 16&#x000a0;h of incubation, no defined liposomes were observed (<bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold>). Scan size of AFM images is 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, adapted from Ramachandran <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12248_2010_9232_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tip&#x02013;Sample Interaction Forces</title><p>When the cantilever tip approaches the sample surface, the sum of the attractive and repulsive forces between them determines the deflection of the cantilever in contact mode and the damping of vibration amplitude in the tapping mode (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Imaging Modes</xref>&#x0201d; below). The overlapping of electron orbitals between the atoms of the tip and the sample are the dominant repulsive force sensed by the AFM cantilever. The Van der Waals interaction is the dominant attractive force sensed by the cantilever, which is primarily due to delocalized dipole&#x02013;dipole interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). The meniscus surface force that exists while imaging in air is another strong attractive force. While imaging in fluids, electrostatic interactions occur between charges of sample and tip, and structural forces such as hydration force, solvation forces, and adhesion forces also come into play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>).</p><p>Torsional deflection of the AFM cantilever is used to measure lateral forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>) and could be used to generate images containing information about the local surface chemistry, like separate lipid and protein clusters in a membrane. In tapping mode, conductive/magnetically coated cantilevers can sense electrostatic/magnetic forces and image, for instance, magnetic domains, surface charge distributions, local surface capacitance, and conductance. In principle, any signal that is spatially resolved (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>) and that is a function of distance from the sample (<italic>z</italic>) can be made into a microscope parameter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Imaging Modes</title><p>The two most commonly employed imaging modes for the AFM are the contact and tapping or vibration modes. In the contact mode, an electronic feedback circuit maintains a constant deflection, ensuring a constant force of interaction between the cantilever tip and sample. The amount of <italic>z</italic> variation required to maintain the interaction force constant is plotted <italic>versus</italic> the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinate, thereby producing a topographic image, although images may not be purely topographical (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Tip&#x02013;Sample Interaction Forces</xref>&#x0201d; above).</p><p>In the tapping or vibration mode, the cantilever oscillates up and down near its resonance frequency by a piezoelectric element on the tip holder. The amplitude of cantilever vibration is maintained constant during scanning by a feedback signal. The image is produced by plotting the displacement of the sample relative to the base of the cantilever necessary to keep the amplitude of the vibration constant. The phase lag between the driving circuit and the actual tip vibration is also measured and used for imaging physical properties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Spatial and Temporal Resolution</title><p>Since the interaction between the AFM tip and specimen is not limited by wavelength, molecular, and even atomic resolution is possible. Spatial resolution depends on the sensitivity of the piezoelectric scanner and may be as high as 0.1&#x000a0;nm laterally and 0.01&#x000a0;nm vertically. Resolution also depends on the size and shape of the probing tip as well as on the material properties of the sample under investigation. In general, the sharper the tip, the higher is the resolution. To this end, we have been able to fabricate the first integrated cantilevered nanotip (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, top right panel) and were able to obtain both high-resolution structural information as well as the electrical characteristics simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Hard, crystalline samples can be imaged with high resolution, and images with atomic and subatomic features have been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Structures &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;nm apart are resolved on non-crystalline arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Biological samples are soft, so resolution is less. Nevertheless, the resolution can still be remarkable with soft specimens. For example, AFM studies on reconstituted ion channels can resolve the substructure of channels and, at times, the subunits within each channel. We, and others, have distinguished between hexameric and pentameric connexons and have shown that amyloid ion channels range from tetramers to octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>).</p><p>Temporal resolution depends on the speed of the feedback electronics as well as the scan size of the specimen. Examination of dynamic behavior requires higher scan speeds. Improving temporal resolution is a rapidly evolving area of AFM design. Current AFMs can image repeatedly and reliably a small line or a point over a sample surface such as a subunit of an ion channel or receptor in a millisecond, a small area such as an ion channel or receptor in less than a second, and an array of 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20 channels in a second or two. The new AFMs under development hold promise to improve the temporal resolution by a factor of two or more in near future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Advantages of AFM</title><p>Important features of AFM include: (1) The physical interaction that underlies AFM imaging is not constrained by wavelength and, therefore, permits the resolution for molecular and even atomic imaging. (2) AFM permits the 3D imaging of surfaces and biomolecules with molecular and submolecular resolution. (3) AFM does not require destructive pretreatment or imaging conditions such as occurs in electron microscopy, nor does it require crystallization as needed for high-resolution X-ray imaging that may affect physiology. (4) AFM can image specimens in a physiologic solution, thereby allowing the investigation of dynamic processes involving molecules, organelles, and other structures in living cells. (5) AFM can be modified to serve as a sensor of intermolecular interaction forces, charge, pH, and other physicochemical properties. (6) AFM cantilever tip<bold>s</bold> can be functionalized chemically or biochemically to allow the identification of specific molecules and the measurement of specific interactions, such as ligand&#x02013;receptor interactions. (7) Precise physical manipulation of biomolecules, dissection of biological structures and tissues, delivery of drugs, ligands, and nanoparticles to specific locations, and the measurement of interactions at specific sites are possible because of the precise nanometer control of the position and the piconewton control of the force of the cantilever. (8) The open architecture of AFM apparatus allows integrating with other complementary techniques, including conventional light and fluorescence microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopies, electrophysiology, opto-electronic manipulators, nano-micro fluidics, <italic>etc</italic>., to obtain complete structure&#x02013;function relationship of biomolecules/structures at molecular resolution in their native physiological environment. This flexibility makes it possible to convert the AFM into a powerful multidimensional AFM (m-AFM) platform. (9) Very small amounts of drug/reagents are required, which is an enormous advantage in pharmacology where the molecules are often quite precious.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>AFM AND NANOPHARMACOLOGY</title><p>Nanopharmacology could be defined as the application of nanotechnologies for drug design and drug delivery to selective molecular targets with improved pharmacodynamic and kinetic profiles for safer and effective drug treatment. This includes understanding the individual nanoscale molecular targets for rational drug design, design, development, and manufacture of nanoscale drug carriers like nanotubes, nanoshells, nanospheres, <italic>etc</italic>., nanostructured materials for drug storage and release in the body, and the ability to call back the drug after its intended effect is achieved via nanosponge, for example.</p><p>The importance of understanding pharmacological targets at their molecular level cannot be overemphasized for the advancement of nanopharmacology. AFM by itself, or along with other complementary techniques (m-AFM), would enable investigators to understand the structure&#x02013;function of both the targets and effectors (drugs) at their molecular scale. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, applications of AFM techniques in nanopharmacology will be categorized broadly into the following sections for this review:

One approach has been to use well-defined and highly purified biological materials, such as gap junctions or reconstituted ion channel proteins and receptors as studied in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Another approach has been to use complementary molecules for proper identification. A powerful feature of the AFM is that the cantilever tip can be functionalized to react very specifically with a target molecule. For example, linking of specific antibodies to the tip via a spacer allows the recognition of its antigen on the surface of a specimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Such images reflect both topography and the strength of interaction between the antibody on the AFM tip and the antigen on the sample. Multimodal imaging also provides an approach for the direct confirmation of structural identity, such as combining AFM imaging with other techniques such as fluorescence microscopy that provides complementary information specific to each target.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>AFM Combined with Optical Microscopy</title><p>As mentioned before, multimodal imaging provides an approach for the direct confirmation of targets being imaged by AFM by various optical microscopy techniques through fluorescent labeling. The open architecture of AFM allows such integration, and, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (bottom left), the AFM has been integrated with optical microscopy. Since its adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), simultaneous fluorescence and AFM imaging has been used to study complex biological systems, including cells cultured on Petri dishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). The approach has been used to link changes in cell mechanical properties, assessed by AFM, to the functionality of hemichannels, determined by fluorescence. Similar approaches could be utilized for studying the effect of drugs on cells/targets. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (bottom right panel) shows a compelling evidence of multimodal imaging application for nanopharmacology. Cisplatin-encapsulated liposomes are imaged to show their real-time uptake by cells in culture by fluorescence as well as by AFM. Significantly, cells allowing the uptake of liposomes containing cisplatin did not survive. AFM imaging revealed that smaller liposome&#x02019;s (&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;nm) were effectively internalized by cells compared to larger preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>AFM Combined with Tools to Assay Ion Conductance or Permeability</title><p>Another powerful application of m-AFM is combining imaging with the assessment of physiologic function, which could be used for target identification. An example of a combined AFM and ion conductance measurement system is the one first developed by Proksch <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>) in which a few-nanometer-thick glass electrode serves two purposes. First, it acts like an AFM cantilever tip and, second, acts as a nanoelectrode for recording ion conductance across a bilayer or a cell membrane. Using this system on a synthetic membrane filter (nucleopore membrane), conductance through 200-nm pores was measured when a potential difference was applied. Such an approach allow identifying molecular targets in unstained cells/tissue, which is otherwise impossible with conventional techniques at a single molecular level.</p><p>As an extension of such a combined AFM and ion conductance measuring system, AFM has recently been combined with an advanced nanochip-supported, double-chamber permeability and transport assay system (Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This combined system allows studying the activity of ion channels and pores and would facilitate high-throughput screening of channel activity modifiers and thus would be a valuable tool for developing therapeutics for channelopathies. ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows an example of one such design in which conductance is measured for ion channels formed by gramicidin that have been reconstituted in a lipid bilayer supported over an ~70-nm diameter nanopore in a silicon chip. Gramicidin is a complex mixture of linear polypeptide antibiotics produced by <italic>Bacillus brevis</italic> that induces ion channel-like activity when in contact with the cell membrane and is a good test structure for defining membrane permeability and transport. In the same setup, images of the nanopore and bilayer were also imaged with the AFM. Significantly, this study also shows that the AFM imaging force is soft enough to image delicate and fragile biological membranes that could be used for identifying targets.</p><p>AFM tips can be made conductive that would allow studying the conformational changes in ion channels, as would occur in response to ligands and other therapeutics. It can also be used for characterizing many advanced materials with wide biomedical applications. Using this conducting AFM, Ionescu-Zanetti <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>) obtained the direct structure&#x02013;function analysis of conjugated polymer blends. Polymer blends have wide biological applications, including micro-actuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>), chemical sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), and light-emitting diodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Optically and electrically conjugated polymer blends are currently being tested for their potential application in defining pathological markers and for the targeted delivery of therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>AFM FOR TARGET IDENTIFICATION: IMAGING ION CHANNELS AND DEFINING CHANNELOPATHIES</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conventional Channelopathies</title><p>Traditionally, channelopathies are considered to have an altered structure and/or function of ion channels. A long and rapidly increasing list of diseases fall into this category, such as the long QT syndrome and its associated potentially lethal arrhythmias that involve mutations in sodium and potassium channels, myotonia congenita involving voltage-dependent chloride channels, some forms of retinitis pigmentosa that involve non-specific ligand-gated channels, cystic fibrosis with defective chloride channel, and a long list of other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>). m-AFM would be an ideal and indispensable platform to study and understand the pathogenesis of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). An example of the potential application of AFM to conventional channelopathies mediated by gap junctions and hemichannels is provided below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Gap Junctions and Hemichannels</title><p>Many years ago, we described the use of what we termed &#x0201c;force dissection,&#x0201d; which is the application of force with the cantilever to expose heretofore inaccessible surfaces. Using this approach, we dissected gap junctions, exposing both the extracellular and cytoplasmic faces of the gap junctions, which could then be imaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). In the earlier years of collaboration, we also assessed the electrophysiologic characteristics of gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). One of us in the early 1990s called AFM the &#x0201c;dream machine.&#x0201d; We dreamed of measuring conductances while imaging came into being, and now, m-AFM can potentially make the dream come true.</p><p>Hemiplaques and hemichannels are non-junctional connexons that are composed of connexin hexamer. In 1995, we observed what we believed were hemiplaques or hemichannels in heart gap junction preparations, but could only speculate on their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). There is increasing evidence that hemichannels are involved in cell volume regulation and in programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>).</p><p>Hemichannels have more recently been imaged in lipid bilayers after reconstitution in liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). A distinct difference was observed between two populations of channel-like structures that correspond to the extracellular and cytoplasmic side of the hemichannels Furthermore, by changing calcium levels in the imaging buffer, hemichannels could be imaged both in their open (low calcium) and closed (normal calcium) state with sub-nanometer resolution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, bottom panel). Using phase imaging, where the phase lag between the tip oscillation in tapping mode and the driving signal is monitored, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>) and surface energy measurements using AFM, a spike in the phase signal of open channels was observed, most likely due to the exposed hydrophobic domains of the hemichannel in open state.

The ability of the AFM to image with high resolution has led to a paradigm shift in amyloidogenic diseases and holds promise to do the same for a number of other diseases. Misfolded proteins can form channels in the cellular membranes and alter ionic homeostasis, which can cause stress and injury to electrically sensitive cells in the body, including for example cardiomyocytes, neurons, and muscle cells. This mechanism has opened an exciting new approach to the understanding of these diseases.</p><p>A series of AFM studies of many amyloids, including amyloid beta protein, amylin, alpha-synuclein, ADan, ABri, and serum amyloid A, revealed ion channel-like structures that show single ion channel activity when reconstituted in membranes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <italic>top left panels</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). The resolution of AFM images has been sufficient to resolve the channel structure and distinguish different subunit arrangements. Electrical recording from these preparations show that these amyloid channels are active and conduct ionic currents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <italic>top right panels</italic>). Cell calcium loading and cell degeneration studies showed that these amyloids induce a pathological response via their ion channel formation, a finding that provides a paradigm shifting perspective of amyloid-dependent pathologies. The pathogenetic mechanism of amyloidosis, at least in part, involves the creation of new channels that allow the toxic flow of ions. These diseases that form channels are not really covered by the classic concept of channelopathies. Yet, with the apparent similarity, we consider them to be &#x0201c;channelopathies of misfolded proteins.&#x0201d;</p><p>In defining a specific structural substrate (ion channels <italic>vs</italic>. undefined features such as plaques and non-fibrillar intermediates), AFM provides a structural basis for understanding the mechanistic details of neurodegenerative (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) and systemic (<italic>e.g.</italic>, diabetes, cancer, heart disease) diseases and for designing drugs and therapeutic evaluations&#x02014;m-AFM is a versatile tool to study the high-resolution structures of these toxic ion channels and could provide a technology platform for screening potential drug candidates for treating these diseases by monitoring their action under real time with structural evidence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>m-AFM FOR DRUG DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>AFM Cantilever-Based Parallel Array of Sensors for Drug Screening</title><p>Emerging technologies are generating AFM cantilever-based array sensors being utilized for many purposes ranging from high-throughput screening of genetic materials to the identification of individual protein/peptides that rely on specific interactions using antibodies and peptides labeled with fluorescence markers. For assaying drugs for &#x0201c;channelopathies&#x0201d; and for identifying biomarkers of diseases, two powerful avenues involve patch clamp(s) on chips and microfluidics. Significantly, AFM cantilever-based array sensors can be combined with both techniques easily and thus provide powerful screening/diagnostic platform.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Patch Clamp on a Chip</title><p>Patch clamp recording is one of the main techniques employed in electrophysiological studies and commonly used in the study of channelopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). The technique, however, is slow with low throughput, making it undesirable for use in drug discovery; an automated patch clamp that uses disposable devices would be a most useful outcome. An example of such an on-chip microchannel planar patch clamp is shown in ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The middle panels show a HeLa cell in the micro-fluidic system and being trapped at one of the channels. Cell deformation can be observed, and current traces show a seal resistance of 144&#x000a0;M&#x003a9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Such devices using a cell reservoir linked to patch channels allows for the simultaneous optical and electrical recording which will facilitate studying the role of ion channels with respect to cellular functions. Future devices can be designed with an improved patch pore geometry and surface treatment to obtain a better seal necessary for single-channel conductance studies. Since the cell reservoir is linked to many patch clamp pores, a parallel readout is possible, analyzing multiple cells simultaneously. Also, there are many new variations of this technique commonly being developed, the most important being an array of patch clamping on nanochips with integrated microfluidics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Microfluidic Viscosity, Velocity, and Molecular Affinity Sensors</title><p>Parallel readout techniques based on AFM cantilever arrays allow for the analysis of several analytes with exquisite intermolecular interaction sensitivity. When combined with micro- (and nano-) fluidic chambers, these array nanosensors become high-throughput screening devices for biomarkers and therapeutic agents. They can probe for instance multiple live cells for their elastic properties or the presence of targets in the cell membrane. Similarly, coating a parallel array of cantilever with a different material or reagent on each lever results in a &#x0201c;chemical nose&#x0201d; that can sense a variety of chemicals or toxins in very small volumes.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> (<italic>Top left and right panels</italic>) shows the schematics of cantilevered microfluidic sensing tools in which a piezoelectric cantilever senses the viscosity and velocity of fluids with different compositions at extremely small volumes.

When combined with local fluorescence sensors (e.g., SPR, photo-sensitive nanoparticles), electrical sensors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, piezoelectric circuitry), and mechanical sensors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, cantilever deflection), an array of cantilevers with specific complements can provide a powerful and highly sensitive tool for high-throughput screening of pathologies and therapeutics. This scheme would allow the identification of an array of biomarkers and potential drug candidate molecules from a very small (micro- to milliliter) amount of biofluid.

The local mechanical properties of a cell are closely associated with biochemical gradients across the membrane, but most techniques that have been used to study single cells averaged over the entire cell. AFM allows the measurement of mechanical properties of cells and portions of cells with high spatial resolution. For instance, rat atrial myocytes were imaged showing clearly the cytoskeletal network beneath the cell membrane and myofibrillar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). Using a constant cantilever deflection maintained by feedback, contractile activity, and the change in contractile activity using perturbations in the buffer environment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), cell stiffness was examined. Different cantilever deflections were observed under different buffer conditions for the same imaging force. This demonstrates the possibility to quantify the coupling between extracellular substrates to cellular functions such as contraction, migration, growth, and differentiation.

A detailed understanding of tissue elasticity can be used for the early diagnosis and for monitoring the disease progression and their treatment outcomes, especially diseases of bones and joints. Indeed, there are some new diagnostic tools being tested to diagnose bone diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>) that resulted from our understanding of the tissue mechanics at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>). The correlation between the mechanical properties and the heterogeneous subunits on a nanoscale has been limited. Using AFM, such correlation studies are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>), as shown in ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p><p>AFM has been able to show the features of a cross-sectioned wool fiber with similar amount of detail as TEM (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, left panels). To study the mechanical properties of the different constituents of the fibers, AFM force mapping has been used. The force curves give information about the stiffness and elastic modulus of the sample regions. For instance, it was shown that the exo-cuticle part of wool fibers has the highest elastic modulus (19.8&#x000a0;GPa), while the endo-cuticle and cortical regions of the fiber cross-section have significantly lower modulus (3.8 and 4.0&#x000a0;GPa, respectively). The indentations made by a diamond tipped cantilever, all made with the same indentation force, look indeed distinctly different for the different regions (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, right panel). Furthermore, the AFM can give conclusive evidence of the role of disulfide bonds in the fiber stiffness. Reduction of such bonds, abundant in the exo-cuticle, using dithiothreitol, resulted in a reduction of modulus to 0.3&#x000a0;GPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>). This has shed new light on the role of the exo-cuticle (small in mass proportion) to the rigidity of wool fibers.</p><p>Of what use are these studies on wool to nanopharmacology? Using the unique feature of defined nanoindentation, the compactness of drug molecules in a pellet, which is critical for their release kinetics in body fluids, could be used as a quality control measure in drug preparations. Significantly, such nanopatterned features would be helpful for creating security watermarks to fight the counterfeit drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>AFM for Drug Delivery</title><p>Targeted delivery of therapeutics has long been an ideal, and a number of different approaches have been tried in the past. Ideally, therapy could be efficient if selective delivery of drugs to the diseased tissue is achieved. Current bulk delivery of drugs by oral or parenteral routes is inefficient since this requires a larger dosage and often has deleterious side effects. Advanced molecular dynamic simulations and nanostructured materials are providing new avenues for drug discovery and delivery systems. Several nanoscale carrier systems, including nanotubes, nanoshells, nanoliposomes, and dendrimers, are being evaluated for effective and targeted delivery. These carriers are designed to contain target guidance molecules that are specific to cell/tissue surface.</p><p>AFM allows the design, characterization, and quality control of these carriers. Integrated multimodal AFM also allows imaging real-time transport of these carriers with specific drugs and their effect on cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). One such successful example of AFM application for characterizing nanocarriers is shown in (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Small cisplatin-encapsulated liposomes (&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;nm) are effective in killing cells due to their efficient internalization by cell endocytosis. An AFM-fluorescence microscopy study was able to demonstrate that the most effective liposomes that were able to deliver optimal dosage for cell toxicity are those with a diameter of 100&#x02013;150&#x000a0;nm. Much smaller liposomes were unable to contain sufficient amount of cisplatin to induce toxicity, and larger liposomes were unstable and not internalized by the cells efficiently.</p><p>Recently, cell-penetrating peptides, including TAT peptide, have been used to deliver various nano-particular pharmaceutical carriers including liposomes, micelles, and nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). Nanocarrier systems incorporated with stimuli-sensitive properties are being developed. These stimuli may include pH, temperature, and redox potential. Even carbon nanotubes filled with a chemotherapeutic agent are being developed for the treatment of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>). These and other nanomedicinals will likely use m-AFM in design, imaging, assessing pharmacologic design, targeting, measuring interactions, and the like.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>ASSESSING TARGET&#x02013;DRUG INTERACTIONS: AFM NANOSENSING</title><p>Multimodal AFM allows us to define targets, such as channels, receptors, <italic>etc</italic>., and their functional activity. The ability to modify the cantilevered tip biochemically adds another dimension to the versatility of the m-AFM techniques. By suitable modification of the tip, one could get a wealth of information about intermolecular interactions at the single molecular level (nanosensing). Attaching a drug molecule directly or indirectly through spacers to the tip will allow studying selective and specific interaction between the target under investigation and the drug molecule. This will be an indispensable tool in drug design and development. Here, we highlight some of the examples where this approach has been adopted to understand intermolecular interactions in our lab.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Structure, Density, Distribution, and Functional Viability of Membrane Receptors and Channels</title><p>Rational drug design should consider the potential biological targets of drugs. As mentioned throughout this review, channels, receptors, and other nanoscale structures are smaller than the current resolution of light microscopic imaging. Electron microscopy and other types of high-resolution imaging cannot be used for live imaging, and hence, their utility is limited. m-AFM, however, withdraws the resolution veil and allows us to see new structures and new dynamic processes in the Lilliputian nanopharmacological world.</p><p>In one of the earliest example of AFM mapping of cell membrane receptors, the AFM was used to identify individual nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) that was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). The structure was determined without fixation or other preparations that might denature the sample, as is often required for EM and other comparable imaging techniques. The density, distribution, clustering, and functional viability of these AChR receptors were confirmed by other relevant techniques, including channel conductance measurements and ligand binding assays (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

In this way, membrane proteins can be probed on living cells. Using such modified and functionalized cantilevers, adhesion forces have been measured and mapped between ligands and receptors on the surface of living cells (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Using force volume imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), regional distribution as well as ligand- or antibody-induced clustering of VEGF receptors have been reported (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>).

The added benefit of using force mapping is that not only are data obtained with respect to unbinding forces, but, simultaneously with imaging, one can also map the stiffness of the cell membrane. The stiffness is obtained by looking at the approach force distance curves in each pixel, which results in an elasticity map. Almqvist <italic>et al</italic>.

Currently, the therapeutic efficacy of medications is determined by bulk assays that have no molecular resolution. Molecular understanding of the drug&#x02013;target interactions could provide important insights into some of these issues. As discussed, single molecules can be imaged routinely with AFM, and it is quite feasible to use AFM or m-AFM to monitor real-time molecular interactions. Here, we highlight some of the key studies which utilized this approach, which could be of great potential in tracking the outcomes following therapeutic intervention.</p><p>An interesting example is the proteolysis of collagen that has been observed using AFM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>). Single collagenase binding to collagen could be imaged and its digestion was followed in real time. Significantly, as shown in panels b and c, very often, collagenase molecules would bind to collagen and dissociate without cutting the collagen molecule. At present, such processes are typically monitored using SDS-PAGE, which gives little information about the real-time activity and the 3D structural information of the binding of the enzyme to its substrate. The dissociation constant derived from single-molecule proteolysis is similar to what is observed from the bulk assay, but clearly not all molecules are cleaved. This is an important issue, for example in a drug cocktail, as used in the treatment of HIV/AIDs where the efficacy of individual molecules cannot be determined from bulk assay.

As described above (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), by tethering antibodies to the AFM tip, and after bringing the tip in contact with the sample of interest, the antigen in the sample cannot only be detected but also unfolded, as reported above. Using this approach, mechanistic details of calcium-mediated opening/closing of Cx43 hemichannels were identified using antibodies specific for different regions of the Cx43 cytoplasmic tail. The precise estimate of the energy needed to unfold (fold) and amount of stretch (contraction) in the channel unfolding measured by AFM shows the promises of using AFM for better measure of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and pharmacological agents with single-molecule resolution. For example, a similar approach could be used to assess the efficacies of channel blockers by measuring their unbinding force.</p><p>A number of years ago, we used AFM to detect microcrystals in synovial fluid from patients with crystal-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>). The study was undertaken to develop a system of &#x0201c;fingerprinting&#x0201d; microcrystals with AFM, and, to a large extent, we succeeded. Some specimens contained more than one type of crystal, while other specimens contained microcrystals that were undetected by polarized light microscopy and by transmission electron microscopy. Crystallization is also important in nephrolithiasis and renal disease. AFM can also be used to study the development of crystals which, in turn, could be a system for assessing the effect of pharmacological intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>).</p><p>Another example would be the use of AFM in studying diseases of the bone. Paul Hansma, one of the pioneers in AFM, and his colleagues, recently wrote a very interesting paper on imaging of bone ultrastructure using atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>).

For example, the loss of synapses and dendrites with eventual neurite degeneration characterize several neurodegenerative diseases. AFM can be used to image and track changes in cellular and subcellular morphology. This, especially if combined with a fluorescence or confocal microscope, gives the opportunity to track changes in the cellular morphology and function induced by various perturbations. For instance, amyloid beta protein-induced changes in endothelial cells were tracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>) (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Since AFM can operate under biological liquid environments, reagents can be added and the physiologic solutions changed during imaging. In this way, the therapeutic capability of a potential therapeutic candidate can be evaluated directly with structural evidence at nanometer resolution. For example, zinc ions and extracellular calcium concentrations have been changed in real time to prevent pathological amyloid beta-induced changes in cellular morphology (ESM Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>, right panels).</p><p>A multimodal AFM combined with fluorescence microscopy can give valuable additional information and conformation of processes observed with the AFM.

Such optical techniques have better temporal resolution since the AFM imaging of a whole cell is time-consuming.
